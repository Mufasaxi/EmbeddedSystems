# Embedded Systems
This repo holds the assignment source codes for one of my lectures titled "Embedded Systems Engineering I".

In each folder a small description of the code functionality is given, alongside the respective C code. Please keep in mind that most of the code is messy and made in a rush, therefore clean code concepts have been ignored, though this may be changed in the future.

The code is to be ran on the STM32 Nucleo-F446RE, with the help of the PlatformIO VSCode extension.

For each assignment the code is saved in a .txt file, that is to be copied into the main.c file before running.
